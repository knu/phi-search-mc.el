;; Created: 25 Aug 2013

;; Package-Requires: ((phi-search "1.1.3") (multiple-cursors "1.2.1"))
;; Keywords: search, cursors

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; phi-search-mc.el provides the following interactive commands:
;;
;; * phi-search-mc/mark-here
;; * phi-search-mc/mark-forward
;; * phi-search-mc/mark-backward
;; * phi-search-mc/mark-all
;;
;; They serve as great way to add fake cursors at your desired points
;; using phi-search.
;;
;; Suggested key bindings are as follows:
;;
;;   (define-key phi-search-mode-map (kbd "C->") 'phi-search-mc/mark-next)
;;   (define-key phi-search-mode-map (kbd "C-<") 'phi-search-mc/mark-previous)
;;   (define-key phi-search-mode-map (kbd "C-. !") 'phi-search-mc/mark-all)
