;;; Commentary:
;;
;; phi-search-mc.el provides the following interactive commands:
;;
;; * phi-search-mc/mark-here
;; * phi-search-mc/mark-next
;; * phi-search-mc/mark-previous
;; * phi-search-mc/mark-all
;;
;;   These functions serve as great way to add fake cursors at your
;;   desired points using phi-search.
